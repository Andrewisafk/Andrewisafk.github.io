      <p>My name is Andrew Guzman. I am a student in Inwood Early College in the 9th grade. My short term goal is to pass all my classes with an 80. My long term goal is to get make a college basketball team. My hobbies are playing video games and basketball. I also like to read sometimes and one of my favorite books is the Trino's Choice. I see myself as sometimes funny and social. </p>
