    <h1>NBA Origin</h1>
    <p><i>The NBA is a 77-year-old organization born from innovation. It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden owner Walter Brown realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, could be used to host basketball games. He established the Basketball Association of America, which in 1949 merged with the National Basketball League to create the National Basketball Association.</i></p>
    <h2>My Passion</h2>
    <p>Basketball was my passion since I was 11. I was introduced to it from my friends. I found great joy in playing the sport and always wanted to improve and be good at it one day. Also, it helps me stay active and healthy and do something fun.</p>
