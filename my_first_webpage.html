    <h1>NBA Origin</h1>
    <p><em>The NBA is a 77-year-old organization born from innovation. It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden owner Walter Brown realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, could be used to host basketball games. He established the Basketball Association of America, which in 1949 merged with the National Basketball League to create the National Basketball Association.</em></p>

    <h2>My Passion</h2>
    <p>Basketball has been my passion since I was 11. I was introduced to the sport by my friends, and I found great joy in playing. I always strive to improve and become better at it. Additionally, playing basketball helps me stay active, healthy, and provides a fun way to spend my time.</p>
