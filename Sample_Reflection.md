# Reflection - Professional Portforlio
**Andrew Guzman** <br>
I would describe this artifact as a fun, yet educational. I say this because we learned how to use html with css together and it was fun to me making my portforlio digital. The purpose of this artifact is to teach us students how to make a professional digital portforlio using Css and Html. <br>
In the beginning my portforlio was sloppy and was not professional. After the peer feedback, my portforlio started look better and now I need to work on my nav bar and my about me, and achievements.
This artifcact contribute to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major by teaching me how html and css can be used in a profession matter and showing me new ways of using html and how I can implement them in my future projects that has to do with html and css. <br>
This artifact first started off on a bad start for me due to the fact that I was not paying attention or taking notes on the lesson. However one of my peers took notes and I asked for it and after that this artifact started getting better as I was understanding more. Next time when my teacher was teaching the class I payed attention and took notes. I then was able to get my resume done, although I am missing some parts I felt successful at the end.<br>
Something I would've done differently was pay more attention and not get distracted by my friends and take notes.<br>
If I was to further develop this artifact, my next step would to finish my navigation bar and do my about me.<br>
